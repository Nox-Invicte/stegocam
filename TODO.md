# Steganography System Plan - COMPLETED

## Steps completed to remove image encryption and focus on pure steganography:

1. [x] Removed CryptoEngine class and all crypto-related code
2. [x] Removed KeyGenerator class
3. [x] Modified StegoController.java to handle only steganography without encryption
   - Removed crypto engine and key generator dependencies
   - Simplified methods to work with plain text only
   - Removed password parameter from steganography methods
4. [x] Removed crypto tests (CryptoTests.java)
5. [x] Updated StegoTests.java to remove encryption-related test
6. [x] Removed crypto package directory

## Current State:
- The application now focuses solely on steganography
- Messages are embedded and extracted without encryption
- All crypto-related code has been removed
- Tests have been updated to reflect pure steganography functionality

## Next Steps:
- Test the steganography functionality to ensure it works correctly
- Verify that messages can be embedded and extracted properly
- Ensure the GUI works with the simplified steganography-only approach
